    "Oh Crap is an trick taking game played with a standard 52-card deck. In the first round, 1 card is dealt to each player. The trump suit is then determined by revealing the top card of the deck. The number of cards dealt increases by 1 each round, but here I'm only concerned about the first round. I want to determine wether the leading player should guess they will get either 0 or 1 tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously this depends on the card the leading playing is dealt, the number of players (2-7), and the scoring system. In Oh Crap, you get 10 points for correctly guessing 1 trick, 5 points for correctly guessing 0 tricks, and 0 points for any incorrect guess. The winning card in the first round must either be of the leading suit, or trump. This means that all 26 cards of the other 2 suits are equally worthless. The 1 card used to determine trump is known to all players, but it can not be dealt to any of the players. This leaves a list of 25 cards that could possibly win round 1. These 25 cards can be ordered by value. The leading player is garunteed to be dealt one of these 25 cards."
